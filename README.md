# autosense_app

This project contains the flutter frontend for a mobile application that can view, add, update and delete stations on a map.
Since the backend [REST API]() is not live and needs to be run locally, this application, likewise, needs to run locally
on an emulator on the same machine as the API. This app was developed and tested on Android, therefore to ensure reliability
you should run the application on an Android emulator.
